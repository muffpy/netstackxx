// A "network interface" that connects IP (the internet layer, or network layer)
// with Ethernet (the network access layer, or link layer).

// This module is the lowest layer of a TCP/IP stack
// (connecting IP with the lower-layer network protocol,
// e.g. Ethernet). But the same module is also used repeatedly
// as part of a router: a router generally has many network
// interfaces, and the router's job is to route Internet datagrams
// between the different interfaces.

// The network interface translates datagrams (coming from the
// "customer," e.g. a TCP/IP stack or router) into Ethernet
// frames. To fill in the Ethernet destination address, it looks up
// the Ethernet address of the next IP hop of each datagram, making
// requests with the [Address Resolution Protocol](\ref rfc::rfc826).
// In the opposite direction, the network interface accepts Ethernet
// frames, checks if they are intended for it, and if so, processes
// the the payload depending on its type. If it's an IPv4 datagram,
// the network interface passes it up the stack. If it's an ARP
// request or reply, the network interface processes the frame
// and learns or replies as necessary.
